\title{Theory and Methods for the Ferromagnetic Ising Model}


% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{abstract}

The Ising model is a historically important problem in statistical mechanics. 
Although it was originally proposed as a crude approximation of ferromagnetic 
phenomena, it furnished statistical mechanics, and later probabilistic science 
as whole, with a new paradigm of graph-based modeling that would prove 
influential.
Especially in the distilled, theoretical study of probabilistic graphical 
models (PGMs), which today is its own field, many methods developed for Ising models 
and spin-glasses have been repurposed and reinterpreted, as have the rich 
physical vocabulary of energies, entropy, and partition functions. 

In this paper, we pay homage to the Ising model by applying modern methods to 
the original problem of ferromagnetism. 
We discuss the theory of the Ising model both from a PGMs and statistical 
mechanics point of view, examining the correspondence. 
We then evaluate a number of approaches to inferenceâ€”Markov Chain Monte Carlo, 
belief propagation, and variational inference. 
Finally, we show the successes and limitations of the Ising model in the context 
of physical phenomena.

\section{Theory of the Ising Model}

A particle with magnetic moment $\vec{\mu}$ in an external magnetic field 
$\vec{B}$ has potential energy:
\[U = - \vec{\mu} \cdot \vec{B}\]
A particle also creates an instrinsic magnetic field defined by magnetic moment 
$\vec{\mu}$. 
The pairwise interactions between particles, described by exchange constants 
$J_{ij}$, thus also have potential energy:
\[U = - J_{ij} \vec{\mu_1} \cdot \vec{\mu_2}\]
We will ignore the short-range Pauli exclusion interactions. 

Now, consider a collection of particles $\vec{\mu_i}$ in the prescence of an 
external magnetic field $\vec{B}$. 
The Hamiltonian, which specifies the total energy of the system, is defined by 
the sum of all pairwise and all magnetic field energies:
\begin{equation}\label{exactE}
    E = -\frac{1}{2}\sum_i \sum_j J_{ij} \vec{\mu_i} \cdot \vec{\mu_j} - \sum_i \vec{\mu_i} \cdot \vec{B}
\end{equation}
In most cases, working with this Hamiltonian is intractable. 
Luckily, we can simplify it by making several strategic assumptions. 

First, we assume all atoms are fermionic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ and identical. 
Then the magnetic moments simplify to $\vec{\mu_i} = \mu \sigma_i$, where 
$\sigma_i \in \{-1, 1\}$ is the spin of the atom. 

Second, we make a mean-field approximation and assume that the atoms are 
arranged in a regular lattice, and that the strength of pairwise interactions 
are negligible for non-adjacent pairs.

Coalescing constants, the Hamiltonian reduces to:
\begin{equation}\label{isingE}
    E = -J\sum_i \sum_{j \in adj(i)} \sigma_i \sigma_j - \sum_i \sigma_i B_i
\end{equation}
Following the Boltzmann distribution, the probability of some state 
$\vec{\sigma}$ at inverse temperature $\beta$ is:
\begin{equation} \label{boltzmann}
    P(\vec{\sigma}) = \frac{1}{Z}e^{-\beta E(\vec{\sigma})} 
\end{equation}

\section{Sample Based Methods of Inference}

Say we want to test if a transition is favored or not. 
In the Ising model, a transition is defined by a change in one or more spins. 

Say we flip one spin $\sigma_i$ in $\vec{\sigma}$ to transition to state 
$\vec{\tau}$. 
We can measure whether this transition will be favored or not using the 
Boltzmann distribution. 
Namely, if $P(\vec{\sigma}') > P(\vec{\sigma})$ then the transition is favored. 
Alternatively, we could compute the ratio of probabilities. 
It turns out that for the Ising model this ratio has a nice form:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{P(\vec{\sigma}')}{P(\vec{\sigma})} = 
    \frac{e^{-\beta E(\vec{\sigma}')}}{e^{-\beta E(\vec{\sigma})}} = 
    e^{-\beta()}
\end{equation}
